# IP Fabric ChatOps

An IP Fabric ChatOps plugin for [Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot).

This plugin uses the [Nautobot ChatOps](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-chatops/) base framework. It provides the ability to query data from IP Fabric using a supported chat platform (currently Slack, Webex Teams, MS Teams, and Mattermost).

## Version Matrix

Here is a compatibility matrix and the minimum versions required to run this plugin:

## Usage

Add a slash command to your chat platform called `/ipfabric`.
See the [nautobot-chatops installation guide](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-chatops/blob/develop/docs/chat_setup/chat_setup.md) for instructions on adding a slash command to your chat channel.

The following commands are available:

- `/ipfabric set-snapshot [snapshot]`: Set snapshot as reference for commands.
- `/ipfabric get-snapshot`: Get snapshot as reference for commands.
- `/ipfabric device-list`: Get the device list.
- `/ipfabric interfaces [device] [metric]`: Get interface metrics for a device.
- `/ipfabric end-to-end-path [src-ip] [dst-ip] [src-port] [dst-port] [protocol]`: Execute end-to-end path simulation between source and target IP address.
- `/ipfabric routing [device] [protocol] [filter-opt]`: Get routing information for a device.
- `/ipfabric wireless [option] [ssid]`: Get wireless information by client or ssid.

IP Fabric uses a concept of snapshots which can include different devices and data. The plugin supports querying specific snapshots via the `/ipfabric set-snapshot` command. The snapshot is set per user and cached for all future commands. If a snapshot is not set, the commands will default to `$last` unless a specific snapshot id is required.

## Installation

The extension is available as a Python package in PyPI and can be installed with pip

```shell
pip install nautobot-chatops-ipfabric
```

> The plugin is compatible with Nautobot 1.0.0 and higher

To ensure the IP Fabric ChatOps plugin is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-chatops-ipfabric` package:

```no-highlight
# echo nautobot-chatops-ipfabric >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `nautobot_configuration.py`

```python
# In your nautobot_configuration.py
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_chatops", "nautobot_chatops_ipfabric"]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
  "nautobot_chatops": {
    # ADD SLACK/MS-TEAMS/WEBEX-TEAMS/MATTERMOST SETTINGS HERE
  }
  "nautobot_chatops_ipfabric": {
      "IPFABRIC_API_TOKEN": os.environ.get("IPFABRIC_API_TOKEN"),
      "IPFABRIC_HOST": os.environ.get("IPFABRIC_HOST"),
      "IPFABRIC_VERIFY": os.environ.get("IPFABRIC_VERIFY", True),
  },
}
```

The plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings

- `IPFABRIC_API_TOKEN`: Token for accessing IP Fabric API
- `IPFABRIC_HOST`: URL of IP Fabric instance
- `IPFABRIC_VERIFY`: Default: True; False to ignore self-signed certificates

## Development

The development environment supports a self-contained environment for developing nautobot chatops commands.

Build of the environment requires `python3-invoke`.  For development purposes, install `poetry` and use it to manage the required packages.

```shell
poetry install        # first time use
poetry shell
```

You can start the deveopment containers locally with an `invoke build` and `invoke start` after copying `creds.env` locally.

```shell
cp development/creds.env.example development/creds.env
invoke build
invoke start
```

You should be able to access nautobot at http://0.0.0.0:8080

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed and automatically built and tested against multiple version of Python and multiple version of Nautobot through TravisCI.

The project is packaged with a light development environment based on `docker-compose` to help with the local development of the project and to run the tests within TravisCI.

The project is following Network to Code software development guideline and is leveraging:

- Black, Pylint, Bandit and pydocstyle for Python linting and formatting.
- Django unit test to ensure the plugin is working properly.

### Development Environment

The development environment can be used in 2 ways. First, with a local poetry environment if you wish to develop outside of Docker. Second, inside of a docker container.

#### Invoke tasks

The [PyInvoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) library is used to provide some helper commands based on the environment.  There are a few configuration parameters which can be passed to PyInvoke to override the default configuration:

- `nautobot_ver`: the version of Nautobot to use as a base for any built docker containers (default: develop-latest)
- `project_name`: the default docker compose project name (default: ipfabric)
- `python_ver`: the version of Python to use as a base for any built docker containers (default: 3.6)
- `local`: a boolean flag indicating if invoke tasks should be run on the host or inside the docker containers (default: False, commands will be run in docker containers)
- `compose_dir`: the full path to a directory containing the project compose files
- `compose_files`: a list of compose files applied in order (see [Multiple Compose files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files) for more information)

Using PyInvoke these configuration options can be overridden using [several methods](http://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/stable/concepts/configuration.html).  Perhaps the simplest is simply setting an environment variable `INVOKE_IPFABRIC_VARIABLE_NAME` where `VARIABLE_NAME` is the variable you are trying to override.  The only exception is `compose_files`, because it is a list it must be overridden in a yaml file.  There is an example `invoke.yml` in this directory which can be used as a starting point.

#### Local Poetry Development Environment

1. Copy `development/creds.example.env` to `development/creds.env` (This file will be ignored by git and docker)
2. Uncomment the `POSTGRES_HOST`, `REDIS_HOST`, and `NAUTOBOT_ROOT` variables in `development/creds.env`
3. Create an invoke.yml with the following contents at the root of the repo:

```shell
---
ipfabric:
  local: true
  compose_files:
    - "docker-compose.requirements.yml"
```

4. Run the following commands:

```shell
poetry shell
poetry install
export $(cat development/dev.env | xargs)
export $(cat development/creds.env | xargs)
```

5. You can now run nautobot-server commands as you would from the [Nautobot documentation](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for example to start the development server:

```shell
nautobot-server runserver 0.0.0.0:8080 --insecure
```

Nautobot server can now be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### Docker Development Environment

This project is managed by [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and has a few requirements to setup your development environment:

1. Install Poetry, see the [Poetry Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for your operating system.
2. Install Docker, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

Once you have Poetry and Docker installed you can run the following commands to install all other development dependencies in an isolated python virtual environment:

```shell
poetry shell
poetry install
invoke start
```

Nautobot server can now be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### CLI Helper Commands

The project is coming with a CLI helper based on [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to help setup the development environment. The commands are listed below in 3 categories `dev environment`, `utility` and `testing`.

Each command can be executed with `invoke <command>`. Environment variables `INVOKE_IPFABRIC_PYTHON_VER` and `INVOKE_IPFABRIC_NAUTOBOT_VER` may be specified to override the default versions. Each command also has its own help `invoke <command> --help`
